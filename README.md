# Multi-resolution_spectral_graph_matching
ENTREGABLE
This function performs a graph matching algorithm explained in:
"Spectral Graph Matching through a Multi-Resolution Approach" by
Victor Gonzalez Navarro and Antonio Ortega

If you use the code, please include the following citation.

V. González and A. Ortega, "Multi-Resolution Spectral Graph Matching," 2019 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP), Taipei, Taiwan, 2019, pp. 2319-2323.

To use this method you need to download and install the following library:
https://epfl-lts2.github.io/gspbox-html/ to plot the graphs

If graph data is available and loaded, the algorithm can be directly run in MAIN.m.
If there is no data, generate_graph.m file can be used to make a pair of graphs.
