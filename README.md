# Multi-resolution_spectral_graph_matching
ENTREGABLE
This function performs a graph matching algorithm explained in:
"Spectral Graph Matching through a Multi-Resolution Approach" by
Victor Gonzalez Navarro and Antonio Ortega

If you use the code, please include the following citation.

V. Gonz√°lez and A. Ortega, "Multi-Resolution Spectral Graph Matching," 2019 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP), Taipei, Taiwan, 2019, pp. 2319-2323.

To use this method you need to download and install the following library:
https://epfl-lts2.github.io/gspbox-html/ to plot the graphs

If you have loaded point cloud data and built the graph on it, You can go through the algorithm by running MAIN.m.

If you don't have data, you can use generate_graph.m file to make a pair of graphs, then play with MAIN.m.
