# Multi-resolution_spectral_graph_matching
This function performs a graph matching algorithm explained in:
"Spectral Graph Matching through a Multi-Resolution Approach" by
Victor González Navarro and Antonio Ortega

If you use the code, please include the following citation.

To use this code you need to download and install the following library:
https://epfl-lts2.github.io/gspbox-html/ to plot the graphs

If graph data is available and loaded, the algorithm can be directly run in 'MAIN.m' file.
If there is no data, 'generate_graph.m' file can be used to generate a pair of graphs.

Other graph matching algorithms we use to compare are in 'Other S.G.M algorithms' foler.
